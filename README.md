## ABSTRACT
###	In this work, we present an indoor localization system built using BLE beacons for three different experimental environments and apply two fingerprint location algorithms namely Weighted k Nearest Neighbors (WKNN) and Nonlinear Least Squares (NLLS). We vary different parameters(filtering method, localization algorithm and fingerprint dimensionality) to achieve the best results and determine useful fingerprint dimensionality and get mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.11m for Hostel Block-C Corridor (36m x 1.8m), 1.59m for IITT Computer Centre (11.4m x 11.4m) and 1.16m for IITT Library (11.6m x 8.4m). We obtained best MAE of 1.11m for the corridor, and more than 65% of points under MAE of 1m for the library.

## CONTRIBUTIONS
###	The main contributions of this work are:
	• a study into the key parameters of BLE localization for different environments for achieving good accuracy;
	• impact of fingerprint dimensionality on error for mulitple localization algorithms.
